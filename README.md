## Simi's Portfolio

Hi, I'm Simi. I am an undergraduate student majoring in data science and statistics and minoring in mathematics. Here I have presented projects that demonstrate my growing skills learned through my education. 

## Projects
-[Python](#Python)
-[RStudio](#RStudio)
-[SQL](#SQL)
-[Julia](#Julia)

## Python
Project | Analysis and Composition | Projection Description
---|---|---|
[Image MNIST Classification](#image-mnist-classification)| CNN, Normalization, Confusion Matrix | Takes the builtin TensorFlow dataset, MNIST, and applied the Convolutional Neural Network to test the accuracy at detecting the handwritten digits with a 99% accuracy. This model consists of techniques that prevent the overfitting of the model with the assistance of batch normalizaiton, and dropout methods. 
[Identify those with Heart Disease](#identify-those-with-heart-disease) | SVD, Binary Classification, Confusion Matrix | Using Heart.csv, the models were run to compare which model would do a better job at identifying the target response.
